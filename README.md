# Handover-Simulation

Techniques to ensure a seamless continuous connection of a communication system at high speeds.

A handover process switches between the RAUs as the Pod progresses in the tube to maintain the signal power, quality, and data speeds from deteriorating. The user equipment in the Pod constantly monitors the signal power and quality it receives. Two successive RAUs overlap for a particular region, and the comparison of signal power and quality is performed in this region. If the succeeding RAU has higher power or quality, then the handover procedure is initiated. The Pod 'breaks' the signal from the preceding RAU and 'makes' the signal with succeeding RAU.

Excuse the level of abstraction, I made a lot of assumptions xP
